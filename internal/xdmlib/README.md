xdmlib is a portable library for parsing and writing XDM metadata, developed at

The eXtensible Device Metadata (XDM) specification is a standard for storing
device-related metadata in common image containers such as JPEG and PNG, while

is based on the Adobe XMP standard. More details at [xdm.org](http://xdm.org).
